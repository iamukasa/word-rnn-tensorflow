 hi
  how to know if my girlfriend is pregnant 
Pregnancy can be confirmed with a pregnancy test, which may be performed by a health care provider or purchased from a pharmacy. Some women who have learned how to detect when their body is ovulating can predict fairly well which day menstruation is due; therefore, they may be aware of a pregnancy as soon as their period is late

  What is pregnancy 
Before a pregnancy can occur, a mature egg and a sperm must join. This event is called fertilization or conception. Fertilization can occur only during the fertile phase of a woman’s menstrual cycle. During the woman’s fertile phase, one of her two ovaries releases a mature egg. This event is called ovulation. Within minutes, finger-like projections (called fimbria) at the ends of the fallopian tube begin moving to surround the egg and draw it into the tube.At the same time, the woman’s cervix moves into a position that eases the sperm’s entry from the vagina. The cervix secretes a large amount of clear cervical mucus. This mucus provides nourishment to enable sperm to survive for several days. It also provides an environment that helps sperm swim upward toward the fallopian tube, to reach the egg. During sexual intercourse, sperms are ejaculated near the cervix. They enter uterus within seconds through the cervix. If the woman is in her fertile period, some sperm may reach the egg in the fallopian tube within five minutes. Other sperm can survive in the clear mucus for up to five days after ejaculation. Hence, a woman who ovulates several days after she has unprotected sex is likely to have sperm remaining in her cervix to fertilize an egg in the fallopian tube.

  how safe is using it when you condoms 
Wearing two condoms is not safer than wearing just one. The friction between the two condoms could cause them to tear.

  how long does a lady have to prevent getting pregnant after sex 
If you forget to take a birth control pill, take it as soon as you remember. If you don't remember until the next day, go ahead and take two pills that day. If you forget to take your pills for two days, take two pills the day you remember and two pills the next day. You will then be back on schedule. If you miss more than two pills, call your health care provider for instructions. Those instructions may be to take one pill daily until Sunday and then start a new pack or to discard the rest of the pill pack and start over with a new pack that same day.Any time you forget to take a pill, you must use another form of birth control until you finish the pill pack. When you forget to take a birth control pill, you increase the chance of releasing an egg from your ovary. However, if you forget to take any of the last seven out of the 28 day pills, you will not raise your chance of pregnancy, because these pills contain only inactive ingredients. If you miss your period and have forgotten to take one or more pills, get a pregnancy test. If you miss two periods even though you have taken all your pills on schedule, you should get a pregnancy test

   What can i do against HIV 
The only completely effective way to prevent STIs is to abstain from oral, anal, and vaginal sexual intercourse. Contact with another person’s body fluids can result in STI infection.For people who have decided to engage in sexual activity, condoms can protect against many, but not all, STIs. For minimal protection, inspect your partner’s genitals, wash your genitals after sexual intercourse, use contraceptives jellies, limit your sexual partners to one person, avoid partners who have sex with other partners, talk to your partner about his or her sexual habits and health.

Good health is considered to be a state of “complete physical, mental and social well being” and not merely the absence of diseases or infirmity. The principles of sexual health are the same:“Physical well being” means good health and hygiene for your genitals and related systems. “Mental well being” means feeling okay about your sexual desires and needs and not guilty or depressed about them. “Social well being” means not facing social discrimination because of your sexual desires and needs, or because of any problem that may result from unsafe sex.A combination of all these factors makes for a (sexually) healthy YOU!.

 MALE CONDOM
A male condom is a soft, tube-like sheath made out of latex (a type of rubber) that is put on a man’s erect penis before sexual intercourse. When the man ejaculates, the sperm is deposited in the condom. Because the sperm is collected in the condom, there is no contact between the man’s and the woman’s body fluids and this reduces the risk of STIs, including HIV, and unintended pregnancy.

 SEMEN
Semen is the fluid that carries the sperm. Sperm makes babies when it joins up with women’s eggs. Most of the time sperm is inside the body. There is only one exit for the sperm, which is through the hole at the end of the penis, called the urethra. When the penis is soft, that hole is used to urinate; when it is erect, it is used to release semen.

 ERECTION
An erection occurs when the penis fills with blood and becomes hard and straight because a boy or man is sexually excited. Erections can happen when boys fantasize and think about sexual things, or sometimes for no reason at all. Boys do not have any control over when this will happen. It is very common for boys to wake up with an erection in the morning. While asleep at night, a boy’s penis will probably become erect and then go down about five to seven times. This is completely normal and healthy. Having erections is not a sign that a boy needs to have sex.

 HOW TO avoid being infected with HIV through sex 
By having a mutually faithful and monogamous sexual relationship with an uninfected partner. If such a relationship is not possible or preferable, then by practising safer sex with every sexual partner, which involves:Using condoms or other latex barriers (like dental dams and femmedoms) properly and every time you practice certain penetrative sexual acts, specifically anal sex, vaginal sex and oral sex – Condoms and other latex barriers prevent exchange of infected blood, vaginal fluids and seminal fluids during these sexual acts.A wide range of other sexual acts where chances of exchange of infected blood, vaginal fluids or seminal fluids are minimal and condoms or other latex barriers need not be used. For example: Dry kissing, deep or wet kissing, petting and fondling, hugging, body rubbing, massage, licking erogenous zones of the body like ears, neck and thighs, sucking fingers or nipples, thigh sex and mutual masturbation.Note: What does the expression “penetrative sexual acts, specifically anal sex, vaginal sex and oral sex” stand for? It stands for the following: Penetration of the penis into the anal passage, vaginal passage or mouth; penetration of the tongue into the anal or vaginal passage; licking of the penis, testicles, clitoris, outer vagina or anus; penetration of fingers or hands into the anal or vaginal passage; and sharing of sexual toys like dildos that are penetrated into the anal or vaginal passage

 DOES man go through menopause
Yes, a man goes through menopause, but to a different extent than a woman. Menopause is a term used to describe the end of a woman's fertility. It literally means the end of menstruation. Female menopause is characterized by changes in hormone production. The male testes, unlike the woman's ovaries, do not lose the ability to make hormones. A healthy male may be able to make sperm well into his 80's or longer.On the other hand, subtle changes in the function of the testes may occur as early as 45-50 years of age, and more dramatically after the age of 70. Because men do not go through a distinct male menopause period, some doctors refer to this as androgen (testosterone) deficiency in the aging male (ADAM). Men typically experience a decline in testosterone production due to aging, but it can also be related to some diseases like diabetes.Whether waning function of the testicles contributes to such symptoms as fatigue, weakness, depression, decreased sexual desire, or impotence remains uncertain. If testosterone levels are low, replacing that hormone may help relieve them. However, replacing male hormones can worsen prostate cancer and high cholesterol levels. Talk to your doctor to see if hormone treatment is right for you.

 VULVA
This stands for the external female genitals.It includes the two folds of skin called the labia, the clitoris, and the vagina.The external genitalia, or the labia, has two sets of rounded folds of skin called the outer and inner lips.
 LABIA
The labia is an external genitalia of the female genitals.The labia covers and protects the vaginal opening. The inner and outer lips come together in the pubic area.
 CLITORIS
This is a small cylindrical body female genitalia near the top of the lips and inside the folds.The clitoris is made up of the same type of tissue as the tip of the penis and is very sensitive. The clitoris has no other function than to help a woman have sexual pleasure.
 URETHRA
The urethra is a short tube that carries urine from the bladder to the outside of the body. The opening to the urethra is very small, and can be hard to find by touch or sight.
 FEMALE URETHRA
The urethra is a short tube that carries urine from the bladder to the outside of the body. The opening to the urethra is very small, and can be hard to find by touch or sight. It is right above the opening to the vagina in female genetalia.
 VAGINA
The vagina is where a man puts his penis during sexual intercourse. Also, menstrual blood and babies come out of the vagina. The vagina is an incredibly elastic muscle that can stretch wide enough to allow a baby to pass through.

 OVARY
Every female is born with thousands of eggs in her ovaries. The eggs are so small that they cannot be seen by the naked eye. Once a girl reaches puberty, a tiny egg matures in one of her ovaries and then travels down a fallopian tube on its way to the uterus. 
 OVULATION
This is the release of the egg from the ovary. The uterus prepares for the egg’s arrival by developing a thick and soft lining like a pillow. If the girl or woman has had sex in the last few days before or the day after ovulation, by the time the egg arrives in the fallopian tube, there might be some sperm waiting to unite with the egg. If the arriving egg is united with the sperm (called fertilization) the fertilized egg travels to the uterus, and attaches to the lining of the uterus (called implantation) and a pregnancy begins. If the egg is not fertilized, there is no pregnancy and the uterus does not need the thick lining it has made to protect the egg. It discards the lining, along with some blood, body fluids, and the unfertilized egg.Ovulation is the periodic release of a mature egg from the ovary. The time from ovulation to the next period is a very consistent length of 9 to 15 days and is controlled by hormones. The two weeks or so before ovulation and the two weeks after make a menstrual cycle about four weeks or a month long.

When blood leaves a woman’s body through the vagina, because the egg that was released into her uterus was not fertilized; signifies that a woman or girl can become pregnant if she has sexual intercourse; occurs around once a month for most women, and is commonly called the “monthly period”; usually lasts between three and seven days
 WHAT HAPPENS DURING MENSTRUATION
If the egg from the ovary is not fertilized, there is no pregnancy and the uterus does not need the thick lining it has made to protect the egg. It discards the uterus lining, along with some blood, body fluids, and the unfertilized egg. All of this flows through the cervix and then out of the vagina. The blood and tissue usually leave the body slowly over three to seven days. This flow of blood can be termed as the “period” too.Menstruation happens for most women about once a month, and that is why it is commonly called the “monthly period.” It usually lasts between three and seven days. It is a sign that a girl or woman can become pregnant if she has sexual intercourse. Women stop menstruating while they are pregnant and may or may not menstruate when they are breastfeeding.Just as some girls begin puberty earlier or later than others, the same is true for periods. Some girls may begin to menstruate at age nine or ten while others may not get their first period until a few years later.
 WHAT IS VAGINAL SECRETION
Girls and women can sometimes see secretions on their underpants or experience a feeling of wetness. These secretions are a whitish liquid. Girls and women often have vaginal secretions around the time of ovulation, when the body is ready to receive and nurture a fertilized egg. Secretions help sperm travel through the uterus to meet the egg for fertilization, so when a girl has secretions, she knows that this is the time when she is fertile.Paying attention to vaginal secretions helps girls and women understand their bodies. Knowing what is normal for the body helps girls recognize things that are not normal. For example, yellow or strong smelling secretions are not normal. These kinds of secretions are often a sign of infection, and should be checked by a health provider.

 WHAT HAPPENS BEFORE AND AFTER PREGNANCY
Before a pregnancy can occur, a mature egg and a sperm must join. This event is called fertilization or conception. Fertilization can occur only during the fertile phase of a woman’s menstrual cycle. During the woman’s fertile phase, one of her two ovaries releases a mature egg. This event is called ovulation. Within minutes, finger-like projections (called fimbria) at the ends of the fallopian tube begin moving to surround the egg and draw it into the tube.At the same time, the woman’s cervix moves into a position that eases the sperm’s entry from the vagina. The cervix secretes a large amount of clear cervical mucus. This mucus provides nourishment to enable sperm to survive for several days. It also provides an environment that helps sperm swim upward toward the fallopian tube, to reach the egg. During sexual intercourse, sperms are ejaculated near the cervix. They enter uterus within seconds through the cervix. If the woman is in her fertile period, some sperm may reach the egg in the fallopian tube within five minutes. Other sperm can survive in the clear mucus for up to five days after ejaculation. Hence, a woman who ovulates several days after she has unprotected sex is likely to have sperm remaining in her cervix to fertilize an egg in the fallopian tube.

 HOW LONG CAN AN EGG SURVIVE BEFORE FERTILIZATION
The egg from the ovary can survive along the fallopian tube for only 24 hours and this is the only window of opportunity for fertilization to take place.Once a sperm has fused with the egg, it creates a barrier to other sperm.

 HOW TO ACHIEVE PREGNANCY TIMING 
Women, men, youth and communities should be educated on the benefits of using family planning to practice healthy timing and spacing of pregnancy (HTSP). HTSP focuses on the health of both the mother and the baby and highlights how family planning can prevent maternal and child illness and death.This is an approach to family planning that:1. Helps women and families delay, space, or limit their pregnancies;2. Helps achieve the healthiest outcomes for women, newborns, infants, and children;3. Works within the context of free and informed contraceptive choice; and4. Takes into account fertility intentions and desired family size.The length of birth to pregnancy interval has been shown to be directly related to infant, child and maternal mortality. The shorter the birth interval, the higher the risk for mortality. In 2007, WHO, in a report on birth spacing consultative meeting held in Geneva in 2005, recommended the following with regard to HTSP:1.  After a live birth, the recommended interval before attempting the next pregnancy is at least 24 months in order to reduce the risk of adverse maternal, perinatal, and infant outcomes.2.  After a miscarriage or induced abortion, the recommended minimum interval to the next pregnancy is at least six months in order to reduce risks of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes.

 UNINTENDED PREGNANCY
Unintended pregnancies are pregnancies that are unplanned, mistimed or unwanted. An unintended pregnancy can also be an early pregnancy i.e. a pregnancy which takes place in a young girl whose body is not mature enough to handle it well, and who is also not emotionally ready to be a mother. An early pregnancy can be wanted or unwanted, planned or unplanned, timed or mistimed – but it is still a danger to the girl and her baby. Unintended pregnancy may be caused by myriad of factors including but not limited to

Unintended pregnancy may be caused by myriad of factors including but not limited to:
 MENOPAUSE
Menopause is when a woman’s menstruation ends. It ends because the hormones that cause eggs to mature in her ovaries stop. When this happens, women can no longer become pregnant. Menopause usually happens after age 45. But, menopause can take place earlier or later than this. Some women may stop menstruating by the time they are 35, and some not until their late fifties.

Menopause usually happens after age 45. But, menopause can take place earlier or later than this. Some women may stop menstruating by the time they are 35, and some not until their late fifties.
 IS vaginal discharge normal
A woman normally produces a vaginal discharge that usually is described as clear or slightly cloudy, non-irritating, and odor-free. During the normal menstrual cycle, the amount and consistency of discharge can vary. At one time of the month, there may be a small amount of a very thin or watery discharge; and at another time, a more extensive thicker discharge may appear. All of these excretions could be considered normal.A vaginal discharge that has an odor or that is irritating usually is considered an abnormal discharge. The irritation might be itching or burning, or both. The itching may be present at any time of the day, but it often is most bothersome at night. These symptoms often are made worse by sexual intercourse. It is important to see your gynecologist if there has been a change in the amount, color, or smell of the discharge.
 CAN a woman get pregnant while breastfeeding
Yes. Even though breastfeeding may suppress or delay menstruation, you can still get pregnant. Ovulation will occur before you start having menstrual periods again, so follow your doctor's recommendation on the appropriate birth control method to use.
 FORGETS BIRTH CONTROL PILLS
If you forget to take a birth control pill, take it as soon as you remember. If you don't remember until the next day, go ahead and take two pills that day. If you forget to take your pills for two days, take two pills the day you remember and two pills the next day. You will then be back on schedule. If you miss more than two pills, call your health care provider for instructions. Those instructions may be to take one pill daily until Sunday and then start a new pack or to discard the rest of the pill pack and start over with a new pack that same day.Any time you forget to take a pill, you must use another form of birth control until you finish the pill pack. When you forget to take a birth control pill, you increase the chance of releasing an egg from your ovary. However, if you forget to take any of the last seven out of the 28 day pills, you will not raise your chance of pregnancy, because these pills contain only inactive ingredients. If you miss your period and have forgotten to take one or more pills, get a pregnancy test. If you miss two periods even though you have taken all your pills on schedule, you should get a pregnancy test.

 Drug Abuse
Drug use can be defined as the use of any chemical or natural substance that causes physical, mental, emotional, or social harm to an individual or to the people close to him or her.
 Drug addiction
Drug addiction is the compulsive use of drugs despite the social, emotional, or physical harm they may cause the individual.The addictive nature of drugs varies from substance to substance, and from individual to individual. Some drugs are more addictive than others, and some people are more likely to become addicted than others. Some legal substances, such as medicines, cigarettes, Khat and alcohol may also be abused. Illicit substances may include marijuana, heroin and cocaine Alcohol and drug addiction has two parts: physical dependency and psychological dependency.
 physical dependency
Physical dependence refers to when the body adapts to the drug requiring more of it to achieve a certain effect (tolerance)This elicits specific physical or mental symptoms (withdrawals) if drug use is abruptly stopped. The addict must continue to use the drug in order to feel normal, or its absence will trigger the symptoms of withdrawal. 
 psychological dependency
Psychological dependency occurs when a drug has been habitually used and the mind has become dependent on the effects and does not feel capable of functioning without it. Its absence produces intense cravings, which are often brought on or magnified by stress. Psychological dependence is also described as satisfying a “hunger” or a “need.” 
 drug experimentation predictors
1. Family factors: Young people who observe their parents using or abusing drugs, alcohol, and other addictive substances are more likely to use or abuse them.Other risk factors include parental absence, inconsistent discipline, poor or lack of communication, conflict between parents and young people, death of parents, poor parenting styles, and family breakup. However, family disruption may not directly lead to drug use, rather, family problems may lead to disenchantment with traditional values and the development of deviant attitudes.2. Early antisocial behaviour: Young people who show early antisocial behaviour may be more likely to use or abuse drugs. Drug use may occur as part of other self-destructive behaviours.3. Peer factors: Spending time with peers who use drugs is perhaps the strongest predictor of a young person’s substance use. Peers who are already involved with drugs may influence others to use drugs through peer pressure, by providing drugs, and by showing others how to use them.4. School factors: such as poor performance, frequent absences, early drop out or little interest in school, and negative school and class room environment may result in use or abuse of drugs by young people.5. Attitudes, beliefs, and personality traits: Some these may make young people more likely to use or abuse drugs. Some characteristics include poor relationship with parents, low interest in education, and feelings of being different from others.6. Response to stress: The of feeling out of control, a sense of meaninglessness, or a lack of direction in life. Young people may use drugs to feel better about life events, which they see as being out of their control

 effects of drug abuse
1. School-related problems: declining grades, absenteeism from school, and dropping out of school.2. Risky sexual practices: initiate sex at a younger age, and have multiple sex partners. This places them at greater risk for unintended pregnancies, HIV and other sexually transmitted infections.3. Delinquent behaviour and juvenile crime: selling drugs, stealing and violence. This may predispose young people to situations that put them in conflict with the law.4. Developmental problems: Substance abuse may negatively impact an adolescent’s mental and physical development.5. Physical and mental consequences: negative effects on the user’s mind and body. The effects can be short-term, such as memory loss, or long-term, such as cancer, infertility, mental illnesses, addiction or HIV-infection from unclean needles.5. Future use disorders: The younger a person is when he or she first drinks alcohol or takes drugs, the more likely that person is to develop a problem with alcohol abuse and addiction to other drugs later in life. Consequently, they suffer more future severe disorders.

In a single session smokers inhale up-to 200 times more smoke than from a cigarette. A typical shisha session delivers 1.7 times the nicotine dose of one cigarette. The longer the shisha session the more nicotine and toxins one takes in. The health effects of shish smoking are similar to those of cigarette smoking.

 MALE CONDOM 
A male condom is a soft, tube-like sheath made out of latex (a type of rubber) that is put on a man’s erect penis before sexual intercourse. When the man ejaculates, the sperm is deposited in the condom. Because the sperm is collected in the condom, there is no contact between the man’s and the woman’s body fluids and this reduces the risk of STIs, including HIV, and unintended pregnancy.

 FEMALE CONDOM
A female condom is a plastic pouch that covers the cervix, the vagina, and part of the external genitals. A woman uses the female condom during intercourse to prevent STIs including HIV, and unintended pregnancy. The female condom is a relatively new form of contraception, which is still not available in many areas. It is a thin polyurethane (a kind of plastic) sheath with two flexible rings, one attached to each end. One ring, at the closed end of the sheath, is placed inside the woman’s vagina and serves as an anchor. The other ring at the open end of the sheath stays outside the vagina and partially covers the lips of the vagina. It is used once and then thrown away. The condom catches the man’s sperm so that it does not enter the vagina.

Condoms do not have holes and do not allow HIV to pass. HIV can only get through if the condom has been damaged or torn. The presence of microscopic pores in some condoms does not matter much, since HIV cannot move on its own and is often attached to white blood cells, which are much larger than the virus. Condoms have of two or three layers of latex, and pores would have to be lined up in order for the virus to pass through. Then, enough of the virus (more than 15,000) would have to pass through to cause infection. The authors of a study investigating leakage concluded that if a condom does not break, it provides 10,000 times more protection than no condom at all.

 HIV TRANSMITTED 
HIV is passed between people in three ways:1. Sex: Penetrative sex with an HIV-infected person where the penis enters the vagina, anus, or mouth of another person. 2. Blood to blood: From an HIV infected person’s blood to another person’s blood through an opening in the body such as a cut, from a transfusion or by sharing something that cuts or pierces the skin (such as knife, razor, or needle). This includes sharing circumcision knives, needles, tattooing or ear piercing, with someone who has HIV. 3. Mother to child: HIV can be passed from a mother who is HIV infected to her baby during pregnancy, at the time of birth, or through breastfeeding.

 PROTECT MYSELF AGAINST HIV
The only certain way to protect against HIV transmission is to abstain from sexual activity.Safe Sex is an alternative way to protect yourself from HIV and AIDS.Other ways include:.1. Being in a mutually faithful relationship with an uninfected person 2. Never sharing needles or other equipment such as razors, circumcision knives

 SAFE SEX
Safer sex describes a range of ways that sexually active people can protect themselves from infection with all sexually transmitted infections, including HIV infection. Practicing safer sex also provides protection against pregnancy. There are many ways for loving and expressing sexual feelings that are not so risky if one can control their desires. Some of them include:1. Hugging 2. Holding hands 3. Kissing 4. Massaging 5. Rubbing against each other with clothes on 6. Sharing fantasies 7. Touching your partner’s genitals, if males do not ejaculate near any opening or broken skin These actions can get out of hand and degenerate in unprotected sex and consequent adverse events including STI, HIV infection and unintended pregnancy.
 PROTECTED SEX 
Using a latex condom correctly for every act of sexual intercourse is called protected sex because when used correctly for each sexual act, condoms can significantly reduce the risk of HIV infection. However, condoms are not 100 percent effective in preventing HIV infection. Unprotected sexual intercourse (without a condom) exposes people to the bodily fluids in which HIV lives. 
 TEST FOR HIV
Physicians currently recommend voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) to people who engage in high risk behavior including:1. Frequent sexual activity with multiple partners 2. Encounters with sex workers 3. Previous treatment for STIs 4. Blood transfusions 5. Anal sexual activity (male or female) 6. Injection use 7. Sexual activity with partners having any of the above 8. Infants born to women with any of the above

 PEOPLE WITH HIV INFECTIOUS TO OTHERS
People with HIV can infect others as soon as they are infected with the virus. People with HIV may not know they are infected and may look, act and feel healthy for a long time, possibly longer than 10 years. It is impossible to tell from looking at someone if he or she is infected.

 SYMPTOMS OF AIDS 
The most common signs that someone has AIDS are diseases such as tuberculosis or pneumonia. However, the following can also be signs that someone has AIDS:1. Sudden, unexplained weight loss 2. Fever for more than one month 3. Diarrhoea for more than one month 4. Genital or anal ulcers for more than one month 5. Cough for more than one month 6. Enlarged lymph nodes 7. Skin infections that are severe or recurring Although the above can all be symptoms of AIDS, the only way to tell if a person is infected with HIV is by testing, because the above can be symptoms of other illnesses or diseases. 
 HIV AND AIDS
HIV stands for “human immunodeficiency virus” and AIDS stands for “acquired immune deficiency syndrome”. In simple terms: HIV is a “virus” that makes the human body’s immune system weak or deficient, while AIDS is an “outcome of HIV infection”. However, being infected with HIV is not the same as having AIDS.AIDS is actually a late stage of HIV infection and comes about only when HIV has made your body’s immunity (defence system) too weak to fight off other infections. It may take several years for AIDS to develop. The healthier your body and the better you take care of it, the longer it will take for AIDS to develop.

 infected with HIV
You can get infected with HIV if certain body fluids from an infected person’s body enter your body. By body fluids we mean blood, seminal fluids (semen, pre-cum) and vaginal fluids, which can host HIV and carry it from one person to another.In almost 80% of cases, HIV is passed on sexually. If you have unprotected penetrative sex –anal, vaginal or oral – with an infected person, body fluids from that person can enter your body. Different sexual acts have different risks. Unprotected anal sex and vaginal sex are considered to be more risky than unprotected oral sex.You can get infected with HIV if you receive blood or blood products from an infected person.HIV can enter your body if you share syringes or other sharp injecting instruments with an infected person because these instruments can lead to exchange of blood from the infected person to you.HIV can also be transmitted from an infected mother to her child during pregnancy (through blood across the placenta), during delivery (through vaginal fluids or blood) or during breastfeeding (through milk).HIV has also been detected in other body fluids like saliva, tears and sweat, but the concentration of the virus in these fluids is too little for transmission of the virus to take place. Viral concentration is much higher in blood, vaginal fluids, seminal fluids and breast milk.

 avoid being infected with HIV through sex 
By having a mutually faithful and monogamous sexual relationship with an uninfected partner. If such a relationship is not possible or preferable, then by practising safer sex with every sexual partner, which involves:Using condoms or other latex barriers (like dental dams and femmedoms) properly and every time you practice certain penetrative sexual acts, specifically anal sex, vaginal sex and oral sex – Condoms and other latex barriers prevent exchange of infected blood, vaginal fluids and seminal fluids during these sexual acts.
 penetrative sexual acts
Penetration of the penis into the anal passage, vaginal passage or mouth; penetration of the tongue into the anal or vaginal passage; licking of the penis, testicles, clitoris, outer vagina or anus; penetration of fingers or hands into the anal or vaginal passage; and sharing of sexual toys like dildos that are penetrated into the anal or vaginal passage

 EXPOSE TO HIV
1. Having unprotected sex with an infected person 2. Sharing knives, needles, syringes (for circumcision or drug use) 3. Having a blood transfusion with infected blood (donated blood is now screened) 4. Mothers can pass the virus to their babies during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding

 VCT 
In Kenya, HIV testing is accompanied by counseling, which usually refers to in-depth discussions with a trained and empathetic person who can help individuals cope with their HIV status and learn how to take care of themselves. If they are not infected, the counselor can help them take steps to keep themselves HIV-free.VCT in full means Voluntary Canceling and Testing.

 AIDS COME FROM
No one really knows for sure where AIDS came from or how long it has been around. What is important to understand is that it affects people from all over the world, regardless of how much money or education they have or what religion they are. It is draining the resources of families, communities and countries. AIDS is an issue that demands the attention of each and every one of us.

 IMMUNE SYSTEM
The immune system is sometimes referred to as a defence system. In the way that a country’s defence system protects it from enemies, the immune system protects the body from diseases. The immune system works like an army by first detecting the enemy, then by sounding the alarm, and lastly by attacking the enemy. A healthy body has its own way to attack invading germs and viruses that make the body sick. The HIV virus works to weaken the body’s ability to attack other germs and viruses. Eventually the body becomes unable to fight off other diseases, which overwhelm the body and cause the HIV positive person to finally die
 HIV PASSED THROUGH KISSING
HIV is not transmitted through saliva. It might be risky, however, to kiss someone if there is a chance for blood contact if the person with HIV has an open cut or sore in the mouth or on the gums. It would be even more risky if both people had bleeding cuts or sores in their mouths. People should use common sense and should wait until any sores or cuts have healed before kissing

 GET HIV INFECTION FROM A MOSQUITO
No. When mosquitoes bite someone they do not inject the blood of the previously bitten person into the next person. They use their saliva as a lubricant. Diseases like malaria are spread through mosquito saliva. HIV gets digested in the mosquito’s stomach before it can find its way to the saliva.

 WINDOW PERIOD
Most HIV tests do not detect HIV but the HIV antibodies produced by the immune system. It is assumed that if a person has the HIV antibody, then they are infected with the virus. It can take as little as 6 weeks or as many as 18 weeks before the body has enough HIV antibodies to be detected by an HIV test. Until this time, tests will give a false negative result. The period between infection by HIV and the presence of enough HIV antibodies to be detected by an HIV test is known as the ‘Window Period’. The majority of HIV infections are believed to be transmitted during this period.

 A PERSON WITH HIV HAVE AIDS
The difference between HIV and AIDS is that one is a virus and the other is a condition or syndrome. A person with HIV may or may not have AIDS. However a person with AIDS will always have HIV in his or her blood. An HIV positive person who does not yet have AIDS may feel and look perfectly healthy, have an active and effective immune system, can work and support his or her family. A person with AIDS may have the symptoms of various diseases which he or she has acquired such as TB, meningitis and cancer. A person with AIDS may be weak and thin and may feel sick. The immune system of a person with AIDS is rapidly become less and less able to protect his or her body.

 THERE A CURE FOR AIDS
There is still no cure for AIDS. Many healers and unscrupulous people have claimed over the years to be able to cure AIDS. All their claims have proved false. We often hear of people who have developed a cure for AIDS. People should be very cautious about claims that a “cure” for AIDS has been discovered unless they have been medically proven.

 I'M RAPED
1. Do not shower. 2. Do not wash any clothes, including underwear.3. Talk to a parent or trusted adult.4. Go to the nearest hospital or health facility for a medical exam and treatment. A doctor should provide treatment, confirm the rape, and obtain evidence. A PRC (Post Rape Care) form should be completed in duplicate at this time. PRC forms have been gazetted in Kenya and can be produced in court as evidence of rape together with a P3 form. A PRC form allows the P3 form to be completed effectively because it contains all the clinical notes. You should be given the original PRC.5. Take the PRC to the police station where a report is entered into the Occurrence Book. You will be issued a P3 form, which should be free of charge. An OB number should be given to you. Bring the clothes worn at the time wrapped in newspaper (not nylon or plastic). If you are severely hurt, the police should be asked to visit the health facility with a P3 form to record the crime. The police should record your statement and that of any witnesses. Only sign it when you are satisfied with what is written. 6. Take the P3 form to be completed by an authorized health worker based on the PRC form. (If up country, go to the District Government Hospital.). The P3 form does not have to be completed immediately. This can be done at a later date after the medical evaluation is completed. Identify the accused for arrest and attend court when the accused is charged.7. Remind participants that rape crimes need to be reported as early as possible so that EC and PEP treatment can begin, investigations can start, and culprits can be arrested if known.

Avoid secluded places including someone’s home when parents or adults are not there, secluded areas or empty buildings.3. Always make sure that someone (parents, siblings, friends, or guardian) knows where you are going, who you will be with, and when you expect to be back.4. Carry a friend’s phone number with you to call if you need help.5. Think about your sexual limits.6. Before going out on a date, think about what you want to do and do not want to do. A decision to be sexual in any way should be made together and never forced.7. Be clear about your sexual limits. Give the message that no means no, not try harder for a yes.8. Trust your instincts. If you feel pressured or threatened in any way, do not hesitate to say what you feel or to leave if necessary.9. Do not worry about being polite. 10. Use strong nonverbal techniques to reinforce what you are saying such as pushing away, not smiling and using a firm voice.

 GERMS
Germs are tiny living organisms, or things, that cause disease when they enter the body. They are so tiny you cannot see them. Bacteria and viruses are both types of germs. Viruses are the smallest germs known to man. In order to multiply, viruses must find a home inside a living organism, like a human cell. Some of the diseases caused by viruses include measles, polio, hepatitis, chicken pox, the common cold and HIV.

 what is sexual health?
Good health is considered to be a state of “complete physical, mental and social well being” and not merely the absence of diseases or infirmity. The principles of sexual health are the same:“Physical well being” means good health and hygiene for your genitals and related systems. “Mental well being” means feeling okay about your sexual desires and needs and not guilty or depressed about them. “Social well being” means not facing social discrimination because of your sexual desires and needs, or because of any problem that may result from unsafe sex.A combination of all these factors makes for a (sexually) healthy YOU!.
 how safe is sex?
Safer sex describes a range of ways that sexually active people can protect themselves from infection with all sexually transmitted infections, including HIV infection. Practicing safer sex also provides protection against pregnancy. There are many ways for loving and expressing sexual feelings that are not so risky if one can control their desires

Hi there, I'm Sophie,What would you like to know?
 what happens when you masturbate? 
Masturbation is commonly defined as touching one's own body, including sex organs, for sexual pleasure
 what happens when you wash your vagina with soap?
you have to cosult with your gynecologist if it affects ph levels around your vagina and lead to yeast infections
 what happens during menstruation? 
If the egg from the ovary is not fertilized, there is no pregnancy and the uterus does not need the thick lining it has made to protect the egg. It discards the uterus lining, along with some blood, body fluids, and the unfertilized egg. All of this flows through the cervix and then out of the vagina. The blood and tissue usually leave the body slowly over three to seven days. This flow of blood can be termed as the “period” too.Menstruation happens for most women about once a month, and that is why it is commonly called the “monthly period.” It usually lasts between three and seven days. It is a sign that a girl or woman can become pregnant if she has sexual intercourse. Women stop menstruating while they are pregnant and may or may not menstruate when they are breastfeeding.Just as some girls begin puberty earlier or later than others, the same is true for periods. Some girls may begin to menstruate at age nine or ten while others may not get their first period until a few years later.

  vaginal discharge 
Girls and women can sometimes see secretions on their underpants or experience a feeling of wetness. These secretions are a whitish liquid. Girls and women often have vaginal secretions around the time of ovulation, when the body is ready to receive and nurture a fertilized egg. Secretions help sperm travel through the uterus to meet the egg for fertilization, so when a girl has secretions, she knows that this is the time when she is fertile.Paying attention to vaginal secretions helps girls and women understand their bodies. Knowing what is normal for the body helps girls recognize things that are not normal. For example, yellow or strong smelling secretions are not normal. These kinds of secretions are often a sign of infection, and should be checked by a health provider.

  how are babies made
Before a pregnancy can occur, a mature egg and a sperm must join. This event is called fertilization or conception. Fertilization can occur only during the fertile phase of a woman’s menstrual cycle. During the woman’s fertile phase, one of her two ovaries releases a mature egg. This event is called ovulation. Within minutes, finger-like projections (called fimbria) at the ends of the fallopian tube begin moving to surround the egg and draw it into the tube.At the same time, the woman’s cervix moves into a position that eases the sperm’s entry from the vagina. The cervix secretes a large amount of clear cervical mucus. This mucus provides nourishment to enable sperm to survive for several days. It also provides an environment that helps sperm swim upward toward the fallopian tube, to reach the egg. During sexual intercourse, sperms are ejaculated near the cervix. They enter uterus within seconds through the cervix. If the woman is in her fertile period, some sperm may reach the egg in the fallopian tube within five minutes. Other sperm can survive in the clear mucus for up to five days after ejaculation. Hence, a woman who ovulates several days after she has unprotected sex is likely to have sperm remaining in her cervix to fertilize an egg in the fallopian tube.

  why does my private part always stink even when I take showers everyday 
Paying attention to vaginal secretions helps girls and women understand their bodies. Knowing what is normal for the body helps girls recognize things that are not normal. For example, yellow or strong smelling secretions are not normal. These kinds of secretions are often a sign of infection, and should be checked by a health provider.

All things sexual health
  Describe a vagina 
The female external genital organs are called the vulva. It includes the two folds of skin called the labia, the clitoris, and the vagina. The external genitalia, or the labia, has two sets of rounded folds of skin called the outer and inner lips. The labia cover and protect the vaginal opening. The inner and outer lips come together in the pubic area. Near the top of the lips, inside the folds, is a small cylindrical body called the clitoris. The clitoris is made up of the same type of tissue as the tip of the penis and is very sensitive. The clitoris has no other function than to help a woman have sexual pleasure. 
  can you tell me anything 
Some women have reported using the female condom without their partners’ knowledge. However, in most cases the female condom requires communication with and cooperation from a woman’s partner.

  the wiring out  of condom 
FOR A MAlE CONDOM  1. Check expiry date and open the condom wrapper carefully (do not use teeth, nails, or other sharp objects). 2. Squeeze out the air from the tip of condom while rolling the condom down the shaft. 3. Roll condom on erect penis all the way down to the base of the penis,you are ready to have intercouse 4. Immediately after ejaculation, withdraw penis from partner, holding on to condom at base of penis so it does not fall off.5. Be careful not to spill semen.6.Remove condom from penis away from partner.7. Dispose of condoms in a place outside of children’s reach (pit latrine, dustbin, or burn it). 8. Never flush a condom down a toilet. 9. Open another condom (if you have sex again). Never try to wash or re-use a condom. You must use a new condom each time you re-enter your partner (if you come out for a while), or start to have sex again. Heres a video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cPMWuFjBE0 FOR A FEMALE CONDOM 1. Check the expiry date. 2. Locate the notch along the edge that makes it easy to open the packet. To avoid accidentally tearing the condom, do not use sharp objects (like fingernails or a knife) to open the packet. 3. Open the packet and take out the condom. 4. Point out that one end is closed, and the other open and that there are two rings: the outer ring at the open end, and the inner ring near the closed end. 5. Explain that the inner ring is meant to be inserted into the vagina, and the outer ring is to remain outside. Heres a video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cPMWuFjBE0

  what is  force  sex 
Rape is defined by the Kenyan law as having sex with a person without their consent or with consent obtained under threat, force, intimidation, fear of bodily harm or misrepresentation
  what is  prgnana
Before a pregnancy can occur, a mature egg and a sperm must join. This event is called fertilization or conception. Fertilization can occur only during the fertile phase of a woman’s menstrual cycle. During the woman’s fertile phase, one of her two ovaries releases a mature egg. This event is called ovulation. Within minutes, finger-like projections (called fimbria) at the ends of the fallopian tube begin moving to surround the egg and draw it into the tube.At the same time, the woman’s cervix moves into a position that eases the sperm’s entry from the vagina. The cervix secretes a large amount of clear cervical mucus. This mucus provides nourishment to enable sperm to survive for several days. It also provides an environment that helps sperm swim upward toward the fallopian tube, to reach the egg. During sexual intercourse, sperms are ejaculated near the cervix. They enter uterus within seconds through the cervix. If the woman is in her fertile period, some sperm may reach the egg in the fallopian tube within five minutes. Other sperm can survive in the clear mucus for up to five days after ejaculation. Hence, a woman who ovulates several days after she has unprotected sex is likely to have sperm remaining in her cervix to fertilize an egg in the fallopian tube.

Girls and women can sometimes see secretions on their underpants or experience a feeling of wetness. These secretions are a whitish liquid. Girls and women often have vaginal secretions around the time of ovulation, when the body is ready to receive and nurture a fertilized egg. Secretions help sperm travel through the uterus to meet the egg for fertilization, so when a girl has secretions, she knows that this is the time when she is fertile.Paying attention to vaginal secretions helps girls and women understand their bodies. Knowing what is normal for the body helps girls recognize things that are not normal. For example, yellow or strong smelling secretions are not normal.

The principles of sexual health are the same:“Physical well being” means good health and hygiene for your genitals and related systems. “Mental well being” means feeling okay about your sexual desires and needs and not guilty or depressed about them. “Social well being” means not facing social discrimination because of your sexual desires and needs, or because of any problem that may result from unsafe sex.A combination of all these factors makes for a (sexually) healthy YOU!.

  how can woman be pregnant       
If the egg from the ovary is not fertilized, there is no pregnancy and the uterus does not need the thick lining it has made to protect the egg. It discards the uterus lining, along with some blood, body fluids, and the unfertilized egg. All of this flows through the cervix and then out of the vagina. The blood and tissue usually leave the body slowly over three to seven days. This flow of blood can be termed as the “period” too.Menstruation happens for most women about once a month, and that is why it is commonly called the “monthly period.” It usually lasts between three and seven days. It is a sign that a girl or woman can become pregnant if she has sexual intercourse. Women stop menstruating while they are pregnant and may or may not menstruate when they are breastfeeding.Just as some girls begin puberty earlier or later than others, the same is true for periods. Some girls may begin to menstruate at age nine or ten while others may not get their first period until a few years later.
  jizz 
Semen is the fluid that carries the sperm. Sperm makes babies when it joins up with women’s eggs. Most of the time sperm is inside the body. There is only one exit for the sperm, which is through the hole at the end of the penis, called the urethra. When the penis is soft, that hole is used to urinate; when it is erect, it is used to release semen.

If such a relationship is not possible or preferable, then by practising safer sex with every sexual partner, which involves:Using condoms or other latex barriers (like dental dams and femmedoms) properly and every time you practice certain penetrative sexual acts, specifically anal sex, vaginal sex and oral sex – Condoms and other latex barriers prevent exchange of infected blood, vaginal fluids and seminal fluids during these sexual acts.A wide range of other sexual acts where chances of exchange of infected blood, vaginal fluids or seminal fluids are minimal and condoms or other latex barriers need not be used. For example: Dry kissing, deep or wet kissing, petting and fondling, hugging, body rubbing, massage, licking erogenous zones of the body like ears, neck and thighs, sucking fingers or nipples, thigh sex and mutual masturbation.Note: What does the expression “penetrative sexual acts, specifically anal sex, vaginal sex and oral sex” stand for? It stands for the following: Penetration of the penis into the anal passage, vaginal passage or mouth; penetration of the tongue into the anal or vaginal passage; licking of the penis, testicles, clitoris, outer vagina or anus; penetration of fingers or hands into the anal or vaginal passage; and sharing of sexual toys like dildos that are penetrated into the anal or vaginal passage

The state of being male or female.Men or male animals as a group or women or female animals as a group.Physical activity in which people touch each other's bodies, kiss each other, etc.Physical activity that is related to and often includes sexual intercourse.
  How do i get pregnant? 
Before a pregnancy can occur, a mature egg and a sperm must join. This event is called fertilization or conception. Fertilization can occur only during the fertile phase of a woman’s menstrual cycle. During the woman’s fertile phase, one of her two ovaries releases a mature egg. This event is called ovulation. Within minutes, finger-like projections (called fimbria) at the ends of the fallopian tube begin moving to surround the egg and draw it into the tube.At the same time, the woman’s cervix moves into a position that eases the sperm’s entry from the vagina. The cervix secretes a large amount of clear cervical mucus. This mucus provides nourishment to enable sperm to survive for several days. It also provides an environment that helps sperm swim upward toward the fallopian tube, to reach the egg. During sexual intercourse, sperms are ejaculated near the cervix. They enter uterus within seconds through the cervix. If the woman is in her fertile period, some sperm may reach the egg in the fallopian tube within five minutes. Other sperm can survive in the clear mucus for up to five days after ejaculation. Hence, a woman who ovulates several days after she has unprotected sex is likely to have sperm remaining in her cervix to fertilize an egg in the fallopian tube.
  How to have safe sex ? 
Safer sex describes a range of ways that sexually active people can protect themselves from infection with all sexually transmitted infections, including HIV infection. Practicing safer sex also provides protection against pregnancy. There are many ways for loving and expressing sexual feelings that are not so risky if one can control their desires. Some of them include:1. Hugging 2. Holding hands 3. Kissing 4. Massaging 5. Rubbing against each other with clothes on 6. Sharing fantasies 7. Touching your partner’s genitals, if males do not ejaculate near any opening or broken skin These actions can get out of hand and degenerate in unprotected sex and consequent adverse events including STI, HIV infection and unintended pregnancy.
